    /// 
    /// It's not directly mapping to a user operation, e.g insert, update, delete.
    /// But it's a internal action which is triggered by user operation.
    /// 
    /// # Scenarios:
    /// 
    /// 1. insert into a table with unique constraint(primary key or unique key).
    /// 
    /// A row with original key is deleted and then new row with the same key is 
    /// inserted. 
    /// Our index design is to make all secondary indexes to point to newest version.
    /// Therefore, we need to build a version chain from the insert log to delete log.
    /// 
    /// For example, old(deleted) row has RowID 100, and new(inserted) row has
    /// RowID 200. they have KeyColumn with same value(k=1).
    /// In such case, for deleted row, we have a secondary index with an entry
    /// (key=1 => RowID=100).
    /// To insert the new row, we first perform the insertion directly on data
    /// page, and get new row inserted(RowID=200). It's necessary because RowID should
    /// be first generated before updating index.
    /// Then we try to update secondary index, and find there is already an entry,
    /// but the entry is deleted(otherwrise, we will fail with an error of duplicate
    /// key and rollback the insert). 
    /// So we lock the deleted row and add undo entry *Move* at the head of its undo 
    /// chain, then link new row's undo log head to "Move" entry.
    /// Finally, we update index to point k=1 to RowID=200.
    /// This is safe because we already locked the deleted row. Any concurrent operation
    /// will see original row locked, and wait or die according to concurrency control
    /// protocol.
    /// 
    /// If we perform index lookup, we always land at the newest version.
    /// And then go through the version chain to locate visible version.
    /// A key validation is also required because key column might be changed and
    /// two key index entries pointing to the same new version. MVCC visible check must
    /// ensure key column matches the visible version built from version chain.
    /// 
    /// If we scan the table(skipping secondary index), we may find deleted rows in
    /// data page with undo header of MOVE entry. We just eliminate such rows, because
    /// we can always find it again from other page through the complete undo chain.
    ///  
    /// 2. fail to in-place update.
    /// 
    /// This can happen when data page's free space is not enough for the update.
    /// The original row is moved to a new page, so should be marked as *MOVE*d.
    /// 
    /// 3. update on rows in a freezed row page or column-store.
    /// 
    /// As DoraDB supports integrated column-store and row-store. To convert row page
    /// to column file, we need to freeze the pages.
    /// The fronzed pages does not support insert, delete or update, but it supports
    /// move rows to new pages.
    /// 
    /// # Possible chains:
    /// 
    /// 1. Move -> Insert.
    /// 
    /// 2. Move -> Update.
    /// 
    /// 3. Move -> Delete.
    /// 
    /// 4. Move -> null.
    /// 
    /// Note: Move always marks the row in data page as deleted. so we need to record
    /// delete flag of previous version. And undo if necessary.
    Move(bool),
    /// Delete an existing row.
    /// We optimize to not have row values in delete log entry, because we always can
    /// find the version in row page.

    /// 
    /// 1. Delete -> null.
    /// 
    /// It can happen when GC is executed and the insert transaction is cleaned.
